# YaleNeuroConnect

The YaleNeuroConnect dataset is available in two online locations: 

1. The behavioral measures, clinical measures, structural MRI, and raw fMRI data (n=382) are available on the NIMH NDA server: https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3276
   To access the NIMH Data Archive system create an account at https://nda.nih.gov/. To learn more about the requirements for requesting access, visit https://nda.nih.gov/nda/access-data-info and https://nda.nih.gov/nda/tutorials/electronic-data-access-request. To browse, filter, and download this data from the NDA website please install the NDA Download Manager as described on the NDA website at: https://nda.nih.gov/nda/nda-tools

3. The functional connectomes and mean ROIs obtained by segmenting the brain into nodes using the predefined function-based Shen268 atlas and Shen368 atlas (n=302): https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/todd_constable_yale_edu/ErNz7PkumGdEgVq7-LvP0SEBlf9jmVwkqAkvkOzH_wXsNw?e=aRWV2q


The fMRI data processing pipeline used by the YaleNeuroConnect study is publicly available, along with an example demonstrating its application on a sample subject: https://github.com/YaleMRRC/YaleNeuroConnect_ProcessingPipeline
