# YaleNeuroConnect

The YaleNeuroConnect dataset is available in two online locations: 

1) The behavioral measures, clinical measures, structural MRI, and raw fMRI data (n=382) are available on the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) server: https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3276.

   To access the NDA system create an account at https://nda.nih.gov/. To learn more about the requirements for requesting access, visit https://nda.nih.gov/nda/access-data-info and https://nda.nih.gov/nda/tutorials/electronic-data-access-request. To download the data from the NDA website please install the NDA Download Manager as described at https://nda.nih.gov/nda/nda-tools.

   In order to download data, please:

         1.1. Visit the NDA Query Tool.

         1.2. Find the data in the NDA Query Tool.

            1.2.1 Visit Data from Labs.
   
            1.2.2 Enter "id:3276" in the text search field.
   
         1.3. Select your Collection, add the data to your "Workspace", then your "Filter Cart."

         1.4. Once your filter cart is done updating, click "Create Data Package/ Add Data to Study."

         1.5. You will then be brought to the Data Packaging page. Click the orange "Create Data Package" button and follow the prompts to create your data package.

         1.6. Wait for the package to be created. You can check the status of your package via your Data Packages dashboard.
         Please note: This may take a few hours. 
   
         1.7. Once your package is ready to be downloaded, open the NDA Download Manager Tool and download your data.

   Please note that the data was formatted to comply with NDA standards. Subject IDs may appear in multiple rows, often due to NDA formatting requirements. In most cases, these rows are duplicates and only the first occurrence should be considered. However, in a few instances, different rows for the same subject contain complementary data. In such cases, each row should be reviewed, as together they represent the full information for that subject.

(** For journal reviewers only, the NDA files are available under https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/anja_samardzija_yale_edu/EhIN0LWzn6NMr7ZWJRqwHvQB6E4Grl1J2bsji7eQjL8WhQ?e=Ee46pG ** with the password included in the manuscript submission ** this text will be removed once the manuscript is published). 


2) On a OneDrive folder: https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/todd_constable_yale_edu/En99p1wBK6xKj3Zuh2T48_cBZe-JXOnaNN8W41U-qySZIw?e=z52dtS, the following files are available:
   
         -The functional connectomes and mean ROIs obtained by segmenting the brain into nodes using the predefined function-based Shen268 atlas and Shen368 atlas (n=302)
   
         -The demographic information across 15 self-report items (n=302, n=403)
   
         -The diagnostic category breakdown (n=302)
   
         -The data of a sample subject, demonstrating the application of the fMRI data processing pipeline (https://github.com/YaleMRRC/YaleNeuroConnect_ProcessingPipeline).
