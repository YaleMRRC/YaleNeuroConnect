# YaleNeuroConnect

The YaleNeuroConnect dataset is publicly shared online. The dataset is available in two locations: 

1. The behavioral measures, clinical measures, structural MRI, and raw fMRI data (n=382): https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3276 

2. The functional connectomes and mean ROIs obtained by segmenting the brain into nodes using the predefined function-based Shen268 atlas and Shen368 atlas (n=302): https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/todd_constable_yale_edu/ErNz7PkumGdEgVq7-LvP0SEBlf9jmVwkqAkvkOzH_wXsNw?e=aRWV2q


The fMRI data processing pipeline used by the YaleNeuroConnect study is publicly available, along with an example demonstrating its application on a sample subject: https://github.com/YaleMRRC/YaleNeuroConnect_ProcessingPipeline
